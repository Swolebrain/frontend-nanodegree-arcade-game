How to play
==================================
On the first screen, click on the character of your choice. In general, the
girls move faster but hop higher so you can hit bugs on a different tile when
moving sideways sometimes. The boys (or rather, the boy and the damnation demon)
move slower but hop very little. The demon almost doesn't hop at all.

Once you've selected your character, use the arrow keys to collect gems. Gems are
worth different amounts depending on color and every time you get hit by a bug
you will lose points and teleport to the original spawn spot.
